We are dedicated to using only the Bible as our rule and guide in the practice of our Christian faith. This means that God's Word is what guides our worship, moral code, organization and overall direction in life. We seek the simple truth of its teachings in order to produce a simple faith in our hearts which creates individuals that are simply Christian, nothing more or less.

Every visitor is an honored guest and every member is a cherished part of our Christian family.
